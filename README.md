Wow, someone is actually looking at this? Well, let me tell you something. This may be ugly, but this is my baby. This is legit made from scratch, each part, a frankenstein of different aspects. If you want some copied version of some Udemy Clourse Project, I'm sure youll find plenty of those.

Not me.

They told me not to try this big of a project. That its too big, too complex. That I would get burned out, not be able to finish.

They were right

Except I'm stubborn.

So here we are.

Lets cut to the chase. I'll make bullet points just to make it easy. I may not keep the bullet points up to date, so some issues may already be fixed.

CURRENT UPDATE DATE 12/16/21

1. First off, the Design sucks because thats one thing I'm confident I can do. So I'll leave the easy stuff last. Should I probably do that 1st? Honestly, I dont think so, honestly. It would look better for employers, but the main Goal is to be as efficient. So I'll take the L for employers looking at this ugly app, and instead keep working naturally.

2. You can Register, login, update your name after you login. And youll stay logged in. Local Passport, Sessions and cookies. Yes I'm proud of that. I'll do Oauth Later. I actually think thats easy considering I just did my own sessions and cookies and database. So I'll do that whenever I do the Design.

3. The Homepage where you update your first name and job, the inputs need fixed so its not password and such, again, easy, ill leave that when I do the general cleanup after all the basic structure is done.

4. You cant message yet, but it is in the worX. Socket is legit a little hard.

5. Thats basically it so far. Its been a lot of work, really. the only routes are the landing page and messages. And you cant message yet. Once I get the messaging implemented, a lot will change, because then I can make it look really pretty. Adding different API calls for different cool things to add, design, little bug fixes, code clean up.

6. The profiles, when you first land on the homepage after logging in, when you clikc the down on the cards, i want that to show the users "Top Ten" which in the future will be anything, including other friends, just like mysapce and xynga did back in the day.

7. I want the user to be able to choose color and designs, just like xynga and myspace back in the day, so that will mostl ikely be in the settings page.

8. I got a perfect source for image database for users to upload pictures. It costs like $35 a month, not bad, so im excited to get this to a bare minimum MVP and get users.
